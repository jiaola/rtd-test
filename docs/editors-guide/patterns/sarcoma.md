## Description 

Sarcomas are malignant neoplasms arising from soft tissue or bone.
This is a design pattern for classes representing sarcomas based on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized sarcma.
We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which generalized over primary and secondary sites.

## Description 

Carcinomas are malignant neoplasms arising from epithelial cells.
This is a Design pattern for classes representing carcinomas based on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer.
We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which generalized over primary and secondary sites.
